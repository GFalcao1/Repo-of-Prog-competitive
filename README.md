📌 What is Competitive Programming?

Competitive programming is the practice of solving algorithmic problems under time and memory constraints. It’s great for:

Sharpening your logic and reasoning

Preparing for technical interviews

Competing in contests and olympiads

Standing out as a backend developer, data scientist, or AI engineer


🧠 Common Topics
✅ Data Structures:

Lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets

Queue (deque), stack, heap (heapq), Union-Find

✅ Algorithms:

Binary search, recursion, backtracking

Dynamic programming (DP)

Graphs (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall)

Sorting and searching

📚 Learning Resources
PyRival – Python CP library

CP Algorithms

NeetCode



🏆 Purpose
Keep a growing personal archive of solved problems, revisit them with improved approaches, and help others getting started with Python in competitive programming.
